    "### Cryptography\n",
    "Cryptography is the science and art of designing secure communication systems. It enables the transmission of information in a way that outsiders cannot understand. This field encompasses techniques such as encryption, decryption, and digital signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption\n",
    "Encryption is the process of converting plaintext or any other type of understandable data into a coded version (ciphertext) that can only be decoded and understood by someone who has the encryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plain Text\n",
    "Plain Text refers to the original, readable information or data that needs to be encrypted. It's the input for the encryption process and the output for the decryption process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cipher Text\n",
    "Cipher Text is the encoded or transformed version of the plaintext after the encryption process. It appears as a random sequence of characters and is not understandable without the decryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decryption\n",
    "Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. It converts ciphertext back to its original form (plaintext) using a specific decryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Double Strength Encryption\n",
    "Double Strength Encryption typically refers to the use of two encryption algorithms or the same algorithm with two independent keys, one after the other, to enhance security. If one encryption method is compromised, the data is still protected by the second layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Encryption\n",
    "Hybrid Encryption combines the strengths of both symmetric (e.g., AES) and asymmetric (e.g., RSA) encryption. Typically, the data is encrypted using a symmetric key, while the symmetric key itself is encrypted using an asymmetric key pair. This combination provides the efficiency of symmetric encryption with the security benefits of asymmetric encryption.\n"
